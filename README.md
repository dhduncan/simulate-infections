# Simulate COVID-19 infections

This project is an off-shoot from a previously developed agent based model and supporting functions, themselves one part of [a frenetic collaboration](https://github.com/njtierney/ttiq-simulation) in support of [modelling for National Cabinet in October/November 2021](https://www.doherty.edu.au/our-work/institute-themes/viral-infectious-diseases/covid-19/covid-19-modelling/modelling).

We inherit the license conditions and relevant contributors.
